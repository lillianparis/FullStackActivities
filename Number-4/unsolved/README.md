# Number-4

- This activity will go over Creating an SVG Element

## Activity

- Welcome to activity 4, creating an SVG element
- There will be a bit more work involved in this activity (repetition is key to remembering the small steps)
- For this activity, you will be developing a rectangle or a circle (your pick). After you decide on a shape, you will need to think of what color you'll want to make the shape.
- To start, you'll need to create your basic HTML template. 
- You'll need to link your javascript file to your html file.
- Next you will need to set your dimensions for your shape! (Hint: Make a width and height variables & give them values)
- Next, you will need to create an SVG element
- Afterwards you will need to append your rectangle or circle (whichever one you chose)
