// Declaring Variables
// Variables are used to store data values. Javascript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables. An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
// Don't worry we will go more into let, var and const later!

// Declaring the variable
const shrek;

// Storing the value of PG in the variable shrek 

shrek = PG;

// Assigning the value of one variable to another

const shrekTwo;

// This is called the assignment operator

shrekTwo = shrek;
