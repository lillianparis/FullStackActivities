# Number - 6

- This activity will go over Scales.

## Introduction

- As a D3 developer, there is one key task that you need to preform; that is, to map values from your data domain and visual domain. For example, mapping your most recent purchase at the commissary/store. Lets say you bought new shoes, that ended up being $40.00 to a 65px-short bar. Respectively, in a sense, this is what D3 is. D3 is about mapping data elements to their visual metaphor (concept, idea, person, place, thing, or idea). 

## Scales

### What are Scales?

- Scales help you perform this kind of mapping. Scales are not only used for mapping but they also serve as fundamental building blocks for other D3 constructs. For example, transitions and axes.
