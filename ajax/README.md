# AJAX

- AJAX stands for Asynchronus Javascript And XML
- AJAX is not a programming language.

- AJAX just uses a combination of:
- A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
- JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

### AJAX lets you :

- Update a Web Page without reloading the page
- Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Send data to a server - in the background
