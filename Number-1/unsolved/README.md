# Number-1

- This activity will cover Enviroment Setup and SOM selection

- Students will create a <div>, <h2>, and <h3> tag. 
- Each tag will have instructions on what text to place inside of them
- Once the three tags are created, students will insert some D3 into the <script> tag
- Students will be using the D3.select() method, the .text() method and the .attr() method

## Common Thought 

### Where should you put your D3 code?

- D3 can be coded into your index.html file, in between <sctipt></script> tags.
- D3 can also be coded into a javascript file, for example, a script.js file.
